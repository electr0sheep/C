To run the program, simply enter the postfix expression as a parameter to the program.

For instance: ./Program 10 2 + 5 3 + /

The program will check for errors in the expression.

As an unrelated side note: the assembly command WRT gave me a good laugh. If only program output were that easy to implement in assembly language!
